 Surround the matched (non-empty) strings, matching lines,
              context lines, file names, line numbers, byte offsets, and
              separators (for fields and groups of context lines) with
              escape sequences to display them in color on the terminal.
              The colors are defined by the environment variable
              GREP_COLORS.  The deprecated environment variable
              GREP_COLOR is still supported, but its setting does not
              have priority.  WHEN is never, always, or auto.
